## Tutorial
A tutorial dataset is included with a subset of code and instructions which can be followed to mimic the steps taken in creating the larger production level models used for sleep stage scoring and narcoleps identification.  The tutorial is given in a publically shared [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15q7EJgIF3gACFIpNlNDCTn9V9eaijE5ztIAPrYi_fgk/edit#heading=h.jsvve8uyrs9f)
